# NOTES 

## THINGS TO FIX:
  ___
  * ### ~~Carousel on skills page:~~
    * ~~The flow from one carousel item to another is abrupt;~~
    * ~~It should be smooth~~
  ___
 * ### ~~Portfolio project description:~~
   * ~~The seperation lines between descriptions are too wide~~
   * ~~It should always be as wide as the text or at least only be little wider than the widest text at all times~~
___
  * ### Portfolio project description:
    * ~~On small phone screen sizes the content-below container appears to be smaller than the overall border of the portfolio project container and this creates a blue border around the content-below container. On larger screen sizes this appears not to be the case.~~
    * The image container needs work regarding the size of the image inside the outer container
